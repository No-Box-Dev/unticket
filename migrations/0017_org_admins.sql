-- App-level admin role, independent of GitHub org admin status.
-- The first authenticated user from each org is auto-promoted to admin by
-- the middleware (atomic INSERT ... WHERE NOT EXISTS). Subsequent users
-- default to member; promotion to admin is via an admin-only API.
--
-- Why a separate table instead of `members.role`: `members` is a verbatim
-- mirror of the GitHub org members API, refreshed by syncMembers. Mixing
-- app-level state into a synced mirror table risks the next reconcile
-- wiping admin assignments. A dedicated table keeps the two concerns clean.
