// GET /api/engineer-stats — per-member counts for the Engineers tab.
//
// Replaces the old client-side approach (download every PR + issue, then run
// O(members x PRs) filters in the browser). All per-member counts are computed
// server-side in a single DB.batch and returned as maps keyed by GitHub login:
//   - openPRs:         open PRs authored by the member                (grid + detail)
//   - reviewing:       open non-draft PRs awaiting their review        (grid + detail)
//   - approvalsGiven:  approvals submitted on other people's PRs       (grid + detail)
//   - mergesOfOthers:  merges of other people's PRs                    (grid + detail)
//   - assignedIssues:  open issues assigned to the member              (grid + detail)
//   - lifetimePRs:     PRs authored, all states                        (detail stat)
//   - prsLast4Weeks:   PRs authored, created in the last 28 days       (detail stat)
//   - issuesClosed:    issues closed by the member                     (detail stat)
//
// Uses the native D1 batch + parameterized SQL (same proven pattern as prs.js /
// issues.js). The reviewer/assignee lists live in JSON-array columns, queried
// with json_each + json_extract. approvalsGiven reads the events table
// (pull_request_review webhooks); mergesOfOthers reads pull_requests.merged_by
// (populated by webhook on merge — historical rows before migration 0034 are
// NULL until an admin backfill fetches per-PR merged_by).
